        <articleItemTitle><![CDATA[13 Skills You'll Need to be a Front End Developer]]></articleItemTitle>
        <articleItemContent><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever looked at your favorite website and wondered exactly what made it tick? Have you looked at the way it was laid out, the way the buttons acted when you clicked them, or any other part and thought, “I wonder how complicated that is?” or, “I wish I could do that”?</p>
<p>All of those things are <a rel="noopener" href="https://skillcrush.com/2017/02/27/front-end-back-end-full-stack/" target="_blank">front end development</a>. While web design is the way a website looks, front end development is how that design actually gets implemented on the web.</p>
<p>Front end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code the website and web app designs created by web designers. The code they write runs inside the user’s browser (as opposed to a back end developer, whose code runs on the web server). Think of it a little like this: the back end developer is like the engineer who designs and creates the systems that make a city work (electricity, water and sewer, zoning, etc.), while the front end developer is the one who lays out the streets and makes sure everything is connected properly so people can live their lives (a simplified analogy, but you get the rough idea). They’re also in charge of making sure that there are no errors or bugs on the front end, as well as making sure that the design appears as it’s supposed to across various platforms and browsers.</p>
<p>I’ve combed through dozens of front end developer job listings to see which skills are the most in-demand right now. These are the things that <em>real employers</em> are looking for in job applicants today (and will still be looking for in the near future). Master these things and you’re certain to land an awesome front end dev job!</p>
<p><em>Psst! Skillcrush is launching a Front End Developer Blueprint! In the course, you’ll get a solid foundation that can put you on the road to landing the developer job you’re after, starting with skills like HTML and CSS and moving on to more advanced skills, like responsive web development, Git, and JavaScript. <a rel="noopener" href="http://resources.skillcrush.com/ftk-front-end-developer-blueprint" target="_blank">Get on the list here</a><span id="hs-cta-wrapper-ab0c3544-2730-477d-8ea0-71125729665e"><span id="hs-cta-ab0c3544-2730-477d-8ea0-71125729665e"></span></span> and be the first to know when the *new* blueprint is open for enrollment!</em></p>
<h2>HTML &amp; CSS</h2>
<p><span class="header1"></span>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the most basic building blocks of web coding. Without these two things, you can’t create a website design, and all you’ll end up with is unformatted plain text on the screen. You can’t even add images to a page without HTML!</p>
<p>Before you get started on any web development career path, you’ll have to master coding with HTML and CSS. The good news is that getting a solid working knowledge of either of these can be done in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>The best part: HTML and CSS knowledge alone will let you build basic websites.</p>
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript lets you add a ton more functionality to your websites. You can even create a lot of basic web applications using nothing more than HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS for short). On the most basic level, JS lets you add a lot of interactive elements to your websites. Use it to create things like maps that update in real time, <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.jacktorrancetrip.com/" target="_blank">interactive films</a>, and online games. Sites like <a rel="noopener" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> use JavaScript heavily to make their user interface so easy to use (the fact that the page doesn’t reload whenever you pin something is thanks to JavaScript!).</p>
<p>It’s also the most popular programming language in the world, so regardless of your dev career plans, it’s a super valuable thing to learn.</p>
<p><em>Read more about JavaScript here: <a rel="noopener" href="http://skillcrush.com/2013/04/15/youve-learned-html-css-now-what/" target="_blank">You’ve Learned HTML and CSS—Now What?</a></em></p>
<h2>jQuery</h2>
<p>jQuery is a JavaScript library: a collection of plugins and extensions that makes developing with JavaScript faster and easier. Rather than having to code everything from scratch, jQuery lets you add ready-made elements to your projects, that you can then customize as necessary (one reason why knowing JavaScript is so important). You can use jQuery for things like <a rel="noopener" href="http://tutorialzine.com/2011/12/countdown-jquery/" target="_blank">countdown timers</a>, <a rel="noopener" href="http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/" target="_blank">search form autocomplete</a>, and even automatically-rearranging and resizing <a rel="noopener" href="http://gridster.net/" target="_blank">grid layouts</a>.</p>
<h2>JavaScript Frameworks</h2>
<p>JS frameworks (including AngularJS, Backbone, Ember, and ReactJS) give a ready-made structure to your JavaScript code. There are different types of frameworks for different needs, though the four mentioned are the most popular in actual job listings. These frameworks really speed up development by giving you a jumpstart, and can be used with libraries like jQuery to minimize how much from-scratch coding you have to do.</p>
<h2>Front End Frameworks</h2>
<p>CSS and front end frameworks (the most popular front end framework is Bootstrap) do for CSS what JS Frameworks do for JavaScript: they give you a jumping-off point for faster coding. Since so much CSS starts with exactly the same elements from project to project, a framework that defines all of these for you upfront is super valuable. Most front end developer job listings expect you to be familiar with how these frameworks work and how to use them.</p>
<h2>Experience with CSS Preprocessors</h2>
<p>Preprocessors are another element that can speed up your CSS coding. A CSS preprocessor adds extra functionality to CSS to keep our CSS scalable and easier to work with. It processes your code before you publish it to your website, and turns it into well-formatted and cross-browser friendly CSS. SASS and LESS are the two most in-demand preprocessors, according to real job listings.</p>
<h2>Experience with RESTful Services and APIs</h2>
<p>Without getting too technical on this one, REST stands for Representational State Transfer. In basic terms, it’s a lightweight architecture that simplifies network communication on the web, and RESTful services and APIs are those web services that adhere to REST architecture. Read more about REST and RESTful services <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s say you wanted to write an app that shows you all your social media friends in the order you became friends. You could make calls to Facebook’s RESTful API to read your friends list and return that data. The same thing with Twitter (which also uses RESTful APIs). The general process is the same for any service that uses RESTful APIs, just the data returned will be different.</p>
<p>While it all sounds really complicated and technical, it’s a simple set of guidelines and practices that set expectations so you know how to communicate with a web service. They also make a web service perform better, scale better, work more reliably, and be easier to modify or move.</p>
<h2>Responsive and Mobile Design</h2>
<p>In the US alone, <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank">more people access the internet from their mobile device than from a desktop computer</a>, so it’s no wonder that responsive and mobile design skills are super important to employers. Responsive design means that the site’s layout (and sometimes functionality and content) change based on the screen size and device someone is using.</p>
<p>For example, when a website is visited from a desktop computer with a big monitor, a user would get multiple columns, big graphics, and interaction created specifically for mouse and keyboard users. On a mobile device, the same website would appear as a single column optimized for touch interaction, but using the same base files.</p>
<p>Mobile design can include responsive design, but also includes creating separate mobile-specific designs. Sometimes the experience you want a user to have when visiting your site on a desktop computer is entirely different than what you want them to see when visiting from their smartphone, and in those cases it makes sense for the mobile site to be completely different. A bank website with online banking, for example, would benefit from a separate mobile site that lets users view things like the closest bank location and a simplified account view (since mobile screens are smaller).</p>

<h2>Cross-Browser Development</h2>
<p>Modern browsers are getting pretty good at displaying websites consistently, but there are still differences in how they interpret code behind the scenes. Until all modern browsers work perfectly with web standards, knowing how to make each of them work the way you want them to is an important skill. That’s what cross-browser development is all about.</p>
<p>Read more about cross-browser compatibility <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-browser" target="_blank">here</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_Web_Standards_in_your_Web_Pages/Developing_cross-browser_and_cross-platform_pages" target="_blank">here</a>, or check out Daniel Herken’s <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.crossbrowserbook.com/" target="_blank">Cross Browser Handbook</a> for a deeper dive.</p>
<h2>Content Managements Systems and E-commerce Platforms</h2>
<p>Almost every website out there is built on a content management system (CMS). (E-commerce platforms are a specific type of CMS.) The most popular CMS worldwide is WordPress, which is behind-the-scenes of millions of websites (including Skillcrush!)—almost <a rel="noopener" href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">60% of websites</a> that use a CMS use WordPress.</p>
<p>The other most popular CMSs include Joomla, Drupal, and Magento. While knowing these won’t put you in as much demand as being a WordPress expert, they can give you a niche that will be desirable among companies who use those systems (and there are plenty out there).</p>
<p>Skillcrush’s <a rel="noopener" href="http://skillcrush.com/blueprint/learn-wordpress/" target="_blank">Freelance WordPress Developer Blueprint</a> is a great place to learn what you need to know to get started!</p>
<h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
<p>It’s a fact of life in web development: bugs happen. Being familiar with testing and debugging processes is vital.</p>
<p>Unit testing is the process of testing individual blocks of source code (the instructions that tell a website how it should work), and unit testing frameworks provide a specific method and structure for doing so (there are different ones for each programming language).</p>
<p>Another common type of testing is UI testing (also called acceptance testing, browser testing, or functional testing), where you check to make sure that the website behaves as it should when a user is actually taking actions on the site. You can write tests that will look for things like particular HTML on a page after an action is taken (like making sure that if a user forgets to fill out a required form field, that your form error box pops up).</p>
<p>Debugging is simply taking all the “bugs” (errors) those tests uncover (or your users uncover once your site is launched), putting on your detective hat to figure out why and how they’re happening, and fixing the problem. Different companies use slightly different processes for this, but if you’ve used one, you can adapt to others pretty easily.</p>
<h2>Git and Version Control Systems</h2>
<p>Version control systems let you keep track of changes that have been made to code over time. They also make it easy to revert back to an earlier version if you screw something up. So let’s say you add a customized jQuery plugin and suddenly half your other code breaks. Rather than having to scramble to manually undo it and fix all the errors, you can roll back to a previous version and then try again with a different solution.</p>
<p>Git is the most widely used of these version control management systems. Knowing how to use Git is going to be a requirement for virtually any development job. This is one of those vital job skills that developers need to have, but that few actually talk about.</p>
<h2>Problem Solving Skills</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing that all front end developers have to have, regardless of the job description or official title, it’s excellent problem solving skills. From figuring out how to best implement a design, to fixing bugs that crop up, to figuring out how to make your front end code work with the backend code being implemented, development is all about creative problem solving.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve created a perfectly-functioning website front end, and you hand it over to the back end developers for them to integrate it with the content management system. All of a sudden, half your awesome features stop working. A good front end developer will view this as a puzzle to be solved, rather than a disaster in the making. Of course, an excellent, senior-level front end developer will anticipate these problems and try to prevent them in the first place!</p>
<h2>What Next?</h2>
<p>If front end development sounds pretty awesome to you, you’re probably wondering where to actually get started.</p>

        <articleItemTitle><![CDATA[How learning Angular made me better React developer]]></articleItemTitle>
        <articleItemContent><![CDATA[<p>I’m a confirmed React evangelist, but currently, my main project at SportsBroker is based on Angular stack. I’ve been learning it for about 3 months, there is still a lot to do, but I must admit that changing base framework approach gave me some overall knowledge how to structure and develop my apps. Eventually, when I do side projects in React, I found myself adopting some of Angular solutions.</p>
<h2>1: Modules</h2>
<p><img style="width: 194px; height: 194px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1042/react_angular1.png?width=194&amp;height=194&amp;mode=max" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/6a1294e5e5d94f54bad0b5562f6f0d11" /></p>
<p>The worst structure approach I’ve ever seen in apps were naming project directories like “components/containers/styles” or in redux — “reducers/actions/types”. Each of folder contained components, but why the hell in component-based frameworks people are grouping by file type?</p>
<p>Of course, not every app is like that, and more common is to group component files in their folders. But how do you scale when you have hundreds of components? Thousands? How do you structure domain model and view containers (pages) related to dumb components?</p>
<p>Modules are the perfect answer to this problem. I’m not a fan how they are implemented in Angular (flattening of providers) and I prefer how it’s done in http://nestjs.com/ —the same concept but services are local by default.</p>
<p>Anyway, what Angular modules do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group some (domain) functionality</li>
<li>Divide app for smaller pieces that can be plugged on/off (if you do it right)</li>
<li>Group lazy loading scope</li>
<li>Declare module-specific components, pipes and directives</li>
<li>Export public components, pipes, and directives</li>
<li>Import other modules to have access to exported declarations and reexport imports</li>
<li>Provide services for Dependency Injection</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of modules in Angular could be “CheckoutModule” in e-commerce shop or “InputsModule” containing custom input components used in forms.</p>
<p>How did it help me with my React projects?</p>
<ul>
<li>I create modules directory in my src, which is the parent for my domain pieces.</li>
<li>Each module contains components specific to its scope.</li>
<li>Each module contains its data model (I like to use Rematch), actions, effects, reducers, services.</li>
<li>Additionally, each module could contain index.js file, reexporting all local files, so they can be accessed importing by other modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the benefit? It scales. New features in the app is easy to add developer doesn’t drown in hundreds of components without context.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 222px; height: 222px;" src="/media/1021/react_angular2.png?width=222&amp;height=222&amp;mode=max" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/6f645d59221340faa5a141256059f4da" /></p>
<h2>2: Dependency Injection</h2>
<p>Angular DI is great. It’s not a popular concept in frontend programming, but hopefully Angular makes it more accessible.</p>
<p>In the nutshell, each component or service can receive the instance of any (provided) service, created during bootstrapping the app.</p>
<p>By default services provided in modules are globally constructed singletons, but their scope can be restricted to components. Unfortunately, services in Angular can’t be scoped to a module.</p>
<p>One of the great advantages of having DI Container is decoupling all dependencies and bringing it to one layer. You register some class (or value) to injectionToken, so later accessing this token will resolve proper class.</p>
<p>This is a great way to bring your app configurations, services to components or replacing mock data services instead of data providers — until they implement the same public interface.</p>
<p>How do I benefit in React?</p>
<p>First, I write better, more testable code, by keeping more SRP and (manually) injecting smaller, more specific services to another.</p>
<p>Second, I experiment with libraries like <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/young-steveo/bottlejs" target="_blank">Bottle.js</a>, ideally, I’d like to achieve a similar effect as in Angular.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 186px; height: 186px;" src="/media/1020/react_angular3.png?width=186&amp;height=186&amp;mode=max" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/56e38d0980444144b81852d4d2bb4df7" /></p>
<h2>3: RXJS</h2>
<p>I’m quite poor at RXJS and reactive programming concepts, but the longer I use it, I find it more useful. It has a steep learning curve but brings a lot of benefits when you embrace it.</p>
<p>In Angular RXJS helps me writing data flow between services and view.</p>
<p>Even Redux as a concept of the immutable data stream is kind of observable.</p>
<p>Learning stream allows me to better understand functional programming, I am also interested in MobX because it’s based on streams as well.</p>
<p><img style="width: 225px; height: 224px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1013/1-w4nfzcnzm4zyvulmiqoezq.png?width=225&amp;height=224" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/cb7c0529c57a4dffa0684ee78abc5349" /></p>
<h2>4: Forms</h2>
<p>Forms are one of the most crucial and one of the hardest to design pieces of frontend app. It has a lot of abstraction layers, data model, validation, server synchronization, UI state and how to synchronize it or how form controls should react with each other.</p>
<p>I’m not a fan of ngModel (2 way data binding) concept (however in Angular 2+ it’s ok), but Reactive Forms are really great. I learned how to design and structure my model, how to listen on form changes and assign validators.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean I try to manually implement the similar solution in my non-angular apps. There is a great library which abstracts your form model called <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik" target="_blank">Formik</a>.

<p><img style="width: 236px; height: 220px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1043/react_angular5.png?width=236&amp;height=220&amp;mode=max" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/2eefe58f48e44aeba65bd2792a471849" /></p>
<h2>5: Code style guide &amp; standardization</h2>
<p>While companies try to force their developers to keep some standards within their projects, Angular team has a higher goal — to standardize whole framework ecosystem. Of course, it’s hard to expect standards in React projects because it’s not a framework, you can use it any way you want to. On the other hand, Google makes use of its position, developing an opinionated framework with strict rules.</p>
<p>There is a <a rel="noopener" href="https://angular.io/guide/styleguide" target="_blank">style guide</a>. I can’t say I agree with everything, but I try to follow the rules. Keeping conventions allow developers to understand a code they are used to see.</p>
<p>There are no “blessed” style guides for React/non-angular apps, but you can strictly force linters and other code style checkers to watch your projects. It’s great to work on and improve your eslint config file and share it within all company’s projects. What Angular tries to do globally, you can at least try to do it in your workplace.</p>

<h2>6: Typescript</h2>
<p>IMO the best feature of Angular is Typescript. Angular is widely used in corporations and huge projects, because many developers can easily work on the project and also non-javascript developers will understand the code. Both reasons are caused not by the framework, but by Typescript.</p>
<ul>
<li>Static types save from *a lot* of problems. It doesn’t force you to be strict, but you can rely on some interfaces defined in your source.</li>
<li>Libraries with typings are self-explaining and developer doesn’t have to check docs all the time.</li>
<li>Code style easy to understand by Java, C# devs</li>
<li>Really helps with refactoring</li>
<li>… hundreds more</li>
</ul>
<p>I really encourage everyone to use TS instead of plain javascript. Setting it in React is as easy as using babel.</p>]]></articleItemContent>

        <articleItemTitle><![CDATA[JavaScript Objects Quickly Explained]]></articleItemTitle>
        <articleItemContent><![CDATA[<p>You know about Arrays right? An array is a ordered collection of data. Similarly, an object is an un-ordered collection of data.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an array:</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="codeBlock" writeText="const justiceLeague = [&#x27;Batman&#x27;, &#x27;Superman&#x27;, &#x27;Martian Manhunter&#x27;, &#x27;Wonder Woman&#x27;, &#x27;Hawk Girl&#x27;, &#x27;Flash&#x27;, &#x27;Green Lantern&#x27;];" />
<p>So I have this array (or ordered list) called <span class="keyword">justiceLeague</span> with 7 members in in.</p>
<p><img style="width: 500px; height: 281.901px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1044/js_objects1.jpeg?width=500&amp;height=281.90104166666663" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/8b579eff66784c44bcf8a2f4e2d264c4"></p>
<p>An array is an ordered list, where:</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="codeBlock" writeText="[&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0: &#x27;Batman&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1: &#x27;Superman&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2: &#x27;Martian Manhunter&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3: &#x27;Wonder Woman&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4: &#x27;Hawk Girl&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5: &#x27;Flash&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6: &#x27;Green Lantern&#x27;&lt;br&gt;]" />
<p>The first item is always placed at zero <span class="keyword">0</span> because, binary!</p>
<p>So if I have to call the first member of the justice league, I will have to call <span class="keyword">justiceLeague[0]</span></p>
<p>Okay, now that you get an overview of Arrays, let’s talk about JavaScript objects.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, objects are typed inside curly braces <span class="keyword">{ }</span></p>
<p>They are just like arrays, but they are not an ordered list.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look:</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="codeBlock" writeText="const crimeSyndicate = {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;boss: &#x27;Superwoman&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;second_in_command: &#x27;Owlman&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;third_in_command: &#x27;Ultraman&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;sub_boss: &#x27;Power Ring&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;henchman: &#x27;Johnny Quick&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;second_henchman: &#x27;White Martian&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;third_henchman: &#x27;Jessica Cruz&#x27;&lt;br&gt;}" />
<p>So with this format, there is not first or last member, they are all designated with their respective <span class="keyword">key</span>s.</p>
<p>So if I were to call the boss of this object, I would do so like this: <span class="keyword">crimeSyndicate['boss']</span> which would return the value ‘Superwoman’.</p>
<p>Just like arrays, you can have sub properties of an object:</p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="codeBlock" writeText="const superHero = {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;name: &#x27;Barry Allen&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;super: {&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;super_hero_name: &#x27;Flash&#x27;,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;power: &#x27;Super Speed&#x27; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;br&gt;}" />
<p>So if I do this: <span class="keyword">superHero['super']['power']</span> I will get an output of ‘Super Speed’. There is another neat way to call this, <span class="keyword">superHero.super.power</span> will output the same result, this is called a dot notation. Objects can also have functions as its members, I talked about it in my next post: Creating The Infinity Gauntlet of Thanos with JavaScript Objects.</p>

        <articleItemTitle><![CDATA[Why Should I Use Umbraco for CMS?]]></articleItemTitle>
        <articleItemContent><![CDATA[<p>You are planning to launch a new website and you want to use a CMS. However, there seems to be so many options to choose from. Everyone is talking about WordPress, which makes you think this must be the best choice, but you may want to spend a bit more time comparing it to other platforms before you make your decision.</p>
<p>One of these platforms is Umbraco.</p>
<p>At CSI Media, we use Umbraco exclusively to create stunning, feature-rich websites. We love it, and we think you will love it too. Here are some of the main reasons you should give it a go.</p>
<h2>Makes managing your content easy</h2>
<p>One of the best features of Umbraco is that it makes it easier than ever to manage your content.</p>
<p>Content is so important for any website because it allows you to connect with your visitors and boost engagement. It is also essential for any SEO that you carry out.</p>
<p>Umbraco has a number of features that makes managing your content a breeze, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can publish your content directly from Microsoft Word;</li>
<li>It saves versions of your content so you never lose your changes;</li>
<li>You can save drafts and publish content with ease;</li>
<li>Content can be scheduled to be published on a future date;</li>
<li>Inserting images and other media is made simple with the media library.</li>
</ul>
<h2>It gives you more control</h2>
<p>Users of Umbraco websites can download a huge number of packages that provide a wide range of features for websites.</p>
<p>For example, if you need to insert a stylish contact form, you can just choose a package you want, download it and install it – all without requiring any design skills.</p>
<p>This ability to add features to your site gives you more control over its functionality and avoids the need to pay a designer whenever you want to make a change.</p>
<h2>The community is large and helpful</h2>
<p>When you have a question about your website or you need some advice, the large and helpful Umbraco community is there to assist you.</p>
<p>Simply post your question and the community of users and developers will be there to help you out.</p>
<h2>Optimise your site from the first day</h2>
<p>If you want to ensure your site gets found in the search engines, you'll need to focus on SEO. Forbes has some good advice on why it is so important to invest in SEO that is worth reading.</p>
<p>With Umbraco, your site will be ready to start optimising from the day it launches, giving you a head start over other websites that do not boast the same level of optimisation.</p>
<h2>You can use it for free</h2>
<p>Umbraco is completely free to use. It is open source, so you only pay for any design work that we do for you, or if you want to download a package because some of these charge a fee to use.</p>
<p>In addition, the open-source nature of Umbraco means you are never tied into anything. While some designers make sure you use their own platforms, which makes it harder to change designers in the future, there are many designers familiar with Umbraco should you want to change.</p>
<h2>Use Umbraco for your website</h2>
<p>Umbraco is, in our opinion, the best option when it comes to creating beautiful, functional websites. If you would like us to create a site for you on the platform, just let us know. Then you too can take advantage of all the benefits, of which there are many.</p>]]></articleItemContent>

        <articleItemTitle><![CDATA[React vs Angular vs Vue.js: A Complete Comparison Guide]]></articleItemTitle>
        <articleItemContent><![CDATA[<p><strong>React vs Angular vs Vue.js</strong> comparison topic has an endless article debating which is better for web development. Counting from the statistics, features, trends, contributors, downloads, and Github stars — everything is being compared to figure out which one can make most of the investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 500px; height: 274.7395833333333px;" src="/media/1038/react_angular_vue.jpeg?width=500&amp;height=274.7395833333333" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/d5ceef9fa0c0403eaa5f9fede441b15f" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">React-vs-Angular-vs-Vue-JS-Comparison-Detailed-Guide</p>
<p>Choosing a tech stack sometimes becomes a tedious task as you need to take every factor into consideration including budget, time, app size, end-users, project objectives, and resources.</p>
<p>Whether you are a beginner, a developer, a freelancer, or a project architect forming strategies, it is a wise decision to be aware of the advantages and drawbacks of each framework in detail. So, this post will not help you select the best one because that decision majorly depends on scopes and suitability. This post can help you gain the complete knowledge of each framework along with trends and insights.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<p>Take a look at this comparison of React vs Angular vs Vue.js according to the Google trends.</p>
<p><strong><em>If we consider past one year, Angular seems like a winner, React is second on the list, leaving a small share for vue.js.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 500px; height: 257.2347266881029px;" src="/media/1039/react_angular_vue1.png?width=500&amp;height=257.2347266881029" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/75806287b6c44987b54f58153df26ef6" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">React-vs-Angular-vs-Vue-JS-Google-Trends</p>
<p>Certainly, there are differences. Without those, there’s a no point of existence. Let’s assume that you are aware of JavaScript and you know the basic difference between framework and JavaScript library.</p>
<h2>React vs Angular vs Vue</h2>
<p>Here are <strong>some questions</strong> and their answers that can help you draw a conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they mature enough to build scalable applications?</li>
<li>Is it easy to find developers for each of the frameworks?</li>
<li>Do you know core concepts behind each framework listed here?</li>
<li>Have you analyzed performance, speed, and learning curve of each framework?</li>
<li>Are there any tools to develop an application using these libraries?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s find <strong>answers</strong> to each question one by one.</p>
<h3>History of Each Framework:</h3>
<p>React is a JavaScript library for building UI components for web applications. React is maintained by Facebook and many leading tech brands are using React in their development environment. React is used by <em><strong>Facebook, Uber, Netflix, Twitter, Udemy, Paypal, Reddit, Tumblr, Walmart</strong></em> and many more. React Native, another popular venture from Facebook is used to build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. Many well-known companies switched to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.spec-india.com/services/reactjs/" target="_blank">React application development</a> due to its outstanding features and functions. <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.spec-india.com/blog/reactjs-vs-vue-js-comparison-of-popular-frameworks/" target="_blank">React vs Vue.js</a> topic is also buzzing around the web and gives you ample insights to select the best framework</p>
<p>Angular is known as TypeScript-based JavaScript framework backed by Google. It is an enormously popular framework for the front-end development of this era. Angular was launched as <strong>Angular 2</strong> or <strong>Angular</strong> that is a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS(Angular.js — old one).</p>
<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.spec-india.com/services/angularjs/" target="_blank">Angular development</a> is widely popular among developers across the globe and used by giant organizations such as <strong>Google, Forbes, WhatsApp, Instagram, healthcare.gov, and many Fortune 500 companies</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, coming to the Vue, Vue.js is one of the most-discussed and rapidly growing JavaScript frameworks. It was created by former Google employee — Evan You who worked on Angular when he was a Google employee. You can consider it a success because of its ability to build attractive UIs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Vue is used by Alibaba, GitLab, Baidu, and appreciated by developers and designers globally for <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.spec-india.com/services/vue-js-development/" target="_blank">Vue.js application development</a>.</p>
<h3>Popularity and Market Trends:</h3>
<p>According to the 2017 Stackoverflow survey, Angular is loved by <strong>51.7%</strong> of developers and React is embraced by <strong>66.9%</strong> of surveyed developers. There is no need to say that JavaScript is the most popular language for web developer occupation grabbing <strong>81.7%</strong> share of a whole. React and Angular have an almost the same level of users’ ratio in the category of popular front-end frameworks. Vue hasn’t occupied a place in any of the above lists but has an ability to participate in this battle.</p>
<p>Now, look at one more statistic of all these three frameworks’ rating on GitHub.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 500px; height: 297.7707006369427px;" src="/media/1040/react_angular_vue2.png?width=500&amp;height=297.7707006369427" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/fc606225f9734d82babc1e6407571f67" /><br />ReactJS-vs-Angular-vs-VueJS-GitHub-Stars-Comparison</p>
<p><em>Image Courtesy: GitHub Stars History(timqian.com)</em></p>
<p>This GitHub stars history for Angular, React, and Vue is showing the popularity of Vue.js among developers. Considering a present scenario, Vue has <strong>108,086</strong>, React gained <strong>106,807</strong>, and angular achieved <strong>38,654</strong> stars.</p>
<p>Vue.js seems to be popular if we observe the above statistics. Despite it is a “one-man-show”, it has the ability to grab the attention of developers due to its well-built and easy architecture.</p>
<p>Above all, you should not forget that Angular and React are being used by big names in the industry. Google uses Angular a lot in their projects and brands such as <strong>Facebook, Airbnb, Dropbox, WhatsApp, Netflix</strong> are using React in their development environment.</p>
<h3>Community Support and Growth</h3>
<p>As React is powered by Facebook and Angular is maintained by Google, there’s a no doubt on the growth of both these frameworks. In both frameworks, updates and releases are published frequently but they have things quite maintained when it comes to migrations. Upgrades are not a problem according to the developers in React and in Angular, there will be one major update every six months. The angular team regularly announces version updates, releases, and depreciation periods.</p>
<p>If we consider Vue.js in such scenario, there’s a migration helper tool which makes migration easier. But in the large app, it might cause a problem as there is no proper roadmap which focuses on versioning and their plans.</p>
<p>React is more flexible than Angular because Angular is a full framework and React is a set of independent, faster, and evolving libraries, and for that, you have to keep an eye on every little module that is no longer supported or maintained.</p>
<h3>It Is Easy To Find Developers?</h3>
<p>It is clear that you will find HTML developers easily than JavaScript fans. React involves more JavaScript and sometimes that’s the reason people geared towards Angular or Vue. Working with HTML makes more sense as React has a different syntax of JSX — JavaScript XML. However, it doesn’t require using JSX in your application but it is a bit tough to be familiar with setup, environment, and architecture of React.</p>
<p>Angular is a pretty good option in such case. You can easily find Angular developers and it has a well-established community with lots of projects, updates, resources and considerably, it has a sustainable future.</p>
<h3>JSX or HTML? — What Would You Prefer?</h3>
<p>This is an endless discussion. Angular uses enhanced HTML whereas React is more about JavaScript. Keep in mind that all these 3 frameworks are component-based. You can reuse components whenever required across the application. If we talk about JSX, JSX is neither a string nor HTML according to the official documentation. It allows developers to create React elements and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript.</p>
<p>There’s an advantage using it because JavaScript is powerful than HTML and it is quite maintained and mature language for front-end development. Vue differs from both the frameworks. It gives separation of concerns and enables developers to write styles, scripts, and other things in an ordered manner. This sounds good to any beginners, designers, and experienced developers who are familiar with HTML in previous projects.</p>
<p>Note: You can use JSX in Vue with the help of babel plugin.</p>
<h3>Framework? Library? What’s the difference?</h3>
<p>Angular is a framework because it provides you with a good start to build an application with the complete setup. You don’t need to look into libraries, routing solutions, and the structure. You can simply start building. React and Vue, on the other side, are more flexible and universal than Angular.</p>
<p>With React, you can do multiple integrations as you can pair, exchange, and integrate libraries with other great tools out there. At this point, React works out of the box due to its flexibility to offer seamless integration but with this, there are chances of wrong decisions and dependencies.</p>
<p>Vue is the cleanest in comparison to these three frameworks. It helps you keep your code efficient with the perfect balance of internal dependencies and flexibilities. It is very simple, straightforward, and easy-to-use JavaScript framework which aims to simplify web development.<br />Other Important Things You Need To Look At</p>
<p>Angular involves dependency injection, a concept where one object provides the dependencies to another object. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand. On the other side, there’s an MVC pattern which splits a project into three different components — model, view, and controller. React does not have any such concept and it helps to build the only View of your application whereas, Angular is based on MVC architecture and it allows developers to build code considering 3 different sections — Model, View, and Controller.</p>
<h3>Performance: Which Is Better?</h3>
<p>Virtual DOM model is very helpful in terms of performance. Both, React and Vue has a Virtual DOM. Due to a well-built structure, Vue delivers great performance and memory allocation. React, on the other side, works well and Angular is already ahead in the competition.</p>
<p>The performance depends on various factors. These three frameworks are comparatively faster than other JavaScript frameworks. You should not take performance into account to draw the conclusion because it mainly relies on the size of the application and optimization of code.</p>
<h3>Native App development? Possible? Take a look:</h3>
<p>Native apps are built for a specific platform. React has React Native, using which you can develop native apps for iOS and Android platform. Angular’s NativeScript is already embraced by many to develop native apps and Ionic framework is widely popular for crafting hybrid apps.</p>
<p>Vue’s Weex platform is evolving and currently, there seems to be no plan to take it further, making it a full-fledged cross-development platform.</p>
<h3>Which Platform Provides An Easy Learning Curve?</h3>
<p>Angular and React have their own ways to do the things, where, Vue is considerably easy. Many companies are switching to Vue because it is easy to work with. Developing in Angular or React requires good JavaScript knowledge and you need to take a lot of decisions regarding third-party libraries.</p>
<p>Not only coding, debugging, and testing can be a real trouble if your application is large and involves a big amount of code in Vue because it allows you to build an application in an old-fashioned JavaScript way.</p>
<p>Angular provides quite informative and clear error message that actually helps developers to fix the issues.</p>
<h3>One-way Data Flow vs. Two-way Data Binding</h3>
<p>This is one of the major differences between React and Angular. Two-way data binding refers to the mechanism where UI fields are bound to model dynamically. When UI element changes, model data is being changed according to it. On the other hand, one-way data flow means there is only a single source of truth — model. Application’s data flows in a single direction, and only the model can change the app’s state.</p>
<p>One-way data flow is easy to understand and deterministic whereas two-way data binding is tough to understand and implement due to its complexity.</p>
<p>Now if we consider our frameworks in this case, Angular uses two-way data binding, React goes for single-data flow, and Vue supports both. Here, the point is, Angular’s two-way approach provides efficient coding structure and developers find it easy to work with. React offers a better overview and understanding because the data is managed in one direction.</p>
<h3>The Rise of Mircoapps and Microservices</h3>
<p>Tech world is embracing mircoapps and microservices at present. React and Vue both provide flexibility to select the things which are important for the app. You need to simply add the required libraries to the source code in React and Vue. Angular uses TypeScript and that’s why it is more suitable for SPA rather than microservices. React and Vue, both frameworks offer more flexibility for developing microapps and microservices.</p>
<h3>Finally, What Should I Choose?</h3>
<p>If you like flexibility more than other features, use <strong>React</strong>.</p>
<p>If you love coding in TypeScript, go for <strong>Angular</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are a JavaScript lover, use <strong>React</strong> because it is all about JavaScript.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of clean code, use <strong>Vue</strong> in your application.</p>
<p><strong>Vue</strong> provides the easiest learning curve and it’s an ideal option for beginners.</p>
<p>If you want separation of concerns in your application, use <strong>Vue</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are a fond of object-oriented programming, <strong>Angular</strong> is definitely a pick.</p>
<p><strong>Vue</strong> is ideal for a small team and a small project. If your app seems to be large and has significant future expansion plan, pick <strong>React</strong> or <strong>Angular</strong>.</p>
<p>For cross-platform app development, React Native is an ideal choice as it provides modern functions and you can easily find resources. Angular, on the other side, needs a sound knowledge of JavaScript to build large-scale applications.</p>
